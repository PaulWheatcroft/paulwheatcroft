The live site has been deployed to https://www.paulwheatcroft.me/

## Design Choices
The site has been designed as a mobile first project. The site was easy to then render on a desktop due to it's simplicity. The only changes were to add a fixed background on desktop as this isn't supported on iOS, to ensure the text was contained withing a readable width.

The layout may extensive use of Boostrap. This includes a sticky header to facilitate quick access back to the top of the site.

WOW.js was used to ensure content is loaded only when needed and animate.css was used to the site animation.
