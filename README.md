The template is integrated with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 4.5.3 which was used throught the project for the structure and layout of the website.

The Code Institute [SampleREADME](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME) was referenced regularly to shape this README correctly.
