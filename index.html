  <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem 
  Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
  Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now
  use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions 
  have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

  <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised 
  words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden 
  in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the 
  Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
  The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
